# Target Models: GPT-4o, LLaMA, DeepSeek, Gemma
# Task: Judge if the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise.
# Notes: No NLI labels are used to avoid priming; models must output E, C, or N only.
# Notes: Includes 10 examples (Types 1–5 with "again" and "possessive" triggers) to guide the model. Output must be E, C, or N.

Prompt (repeated for every turn):
Consider the truth value of the premise. If the premise is true, does it necessarily mean that the hypothesis must also be true?

Output:
E — if the hypothesis must always be true  
C — if the hypothesis must always be false  
N — if the hypothesis may be either true or false  

Do not output anything other than E, C, or N.
