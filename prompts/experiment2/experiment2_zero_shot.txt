# Target Models: GPT-4o, LLaMA, DeepSeek, Gemma
# Task: Judge if the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise.
# Notes: No NLI labels are used to avoid priming; models must output E, C, or N only.

Prompt:
Consider the truth value of the premise. If the premise is true, does it necessarily mean that the hypothesis must also be true?

Output:
E — if the hypothesis must always be true  
C — if the hypothesis must always be false  
N — if the hypothesis may be either true or false

Do not output anything other than E, C, or N.
